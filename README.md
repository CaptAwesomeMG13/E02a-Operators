# E02a-Operators
An exercise exploring python operators and data types

For this exercise, you will need to edit main.py. The file is broken into many functions (def blocks), each of which is designed to perform a basic operation. Many of these are arithmetic, some work with lists or strings, and others produce random values.

To help you along, I have implemented the add function. Also, here are a few online resources that might be useful:

 * [Python operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)
 * [Python built-in data types](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)
 * [The Python slice operator](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/beginner-python-tutorials/slice-operator/)
 * [The Python Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
 * [Python lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

 As always, commit and push your changes to GitHub, and then turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.

The grading criteria will be as follows:

* [1 point] Repository contains an appropriate software license
* [1 point] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
* [8] Accomplishes the objective of the exercise

10 points total

This project uses lots of different operation to get the correct answer of the problems.
Most of these were fairly straight forward until it got to the lists section. This is
the section I had the most issues with and could not even get all of them working. The
last ones has truly stumped me have tried a lot to get them to work yet nothing goes through.
All of the other parts should be good and I am a little familiar with the random class.
I hope to see the correct ways of how to finish off the lists because right now they are 
really stumping me. Thank you and hope you enjoyed the rest of the project.
