# E02a-Operators
An exercise exploring python operators and data types

For this exercise, you will need to edit main.py. The file is broken into many functions (def blocks), each of which is designed to perform a basic operation. Many of these are arithmetic, some work with lists or strings, and others produce random values.

To help you along, I have implemented the add function. Also, here are a few online resources that might be useful:

 * [Python operators](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm)
 * [Python built-in data types](https://realpython.com/python-data-types/)
 * [The Python slice operator](https://techwithtim.net/tutorials/python-programming/beginner-python-tutorials/slice-operator/)
 * [The Python Random Module](https://www.pythonforbeginners.com/random/how-to-use-the-random-module-in-python)
 * [Python lists](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp)

 As always, commit and push your changes to GitHub, and then turn in the URL to your repository on Canvas.

* [1 point] Repository contains an appropriate software license
* [1 point] Repository contains a descriptive README.md
* [8] Accomplishes the objective of the exercise
